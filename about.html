          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Hello, My name is Joshua Augsburg. Welcome to my  website, for those interested in coding please feel free to take a look at my <a href="http://github.com/Jcraya1">Github profile</a>. I'm continuing my path down learning how to code, and using this as my medium. I would like to get a job that I would enjoy, which I believe working with computers would accomplish. Computers have always been interesting to me. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, cooking, reading, and learning. I think it will be fun to continue learning more about coding, and I hope that you enjoy looking around my site as much as I have creating it. Any questions or comments can be sent to me at the e-mail provided.</p>

          <h3>General Information</h3>

I'm not sure what the future holds for me and am willing to accept that while we can guide our path we can't fully control it. Thank you for taking the time to look here and get to know a little about me.</p>
